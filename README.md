# Group-Project-1: Quiz-Game 

I enjoy JavaScript because it utilizes both Functional programming and Object-oriented programming.

This is a quiz game designed to test your knowledge in 3 different genres. You will be asked questions in Math, History and Science with 4 challenging questions. For this Quiz-Game, we used CSS, JavaScript and the HTML to create an application that creates the quiz.
