# Group-Project-1: Quiz-Game 

I enjoy JavaScript because it utilizes both Functional programming and Object-oriented programming.

This is a quiz game designed to test your knowledge in 3 different genres. You will be asked questions in Math, History and Science with 4 challenging questions. We want to create a game that will be educational and entertaining to the different users who play. For this Quiz-Game, we used CSS, JavaScript and the HTML to create an application that creates the quiz. 

## User Story

## Breakdown of tasks and roles

Francis Lao was in charge of the JavaScript and the Math genre of the game.
